Computer Organization and Digital Design Projects - CS1050 - Semester 2

In this repository, various projects related to Computer Organization and Digital Design are uploaded. The projects are designed using Verilog HDL and tested using test benches. 

First, the components such as ripple carry adder, combinational circuits, counter, arithmatic unit, 7 segment display are designed. Then, the components are integrated to design a simple 4-bit nano processor.
