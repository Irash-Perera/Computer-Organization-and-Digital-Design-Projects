### Assembly Programming

#### Assigned Task:
<p>In this lab, some simple Assembly programs will be designed and developed to achieve given objectives. First, we modify some of the examples given with smz32 to improve their behavior. Then a new Assembly program to calculate the product of the integers from 1 to 5 will be developed and output will be displayed on a 7-segement display. Also, some simple input and output devices will be interfaced to the microprocessor. And finally, the functionality of them should be checked by simulating them via smz32</p>
