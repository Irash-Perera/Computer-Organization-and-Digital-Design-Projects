### Combinational Circuits

#### Assigned Task:

<p>In this lab, some types of decoders as well as a multiplexer should be designed using Vivado. Here, 2 to 4 decoder, 3 to 8 decoder and 8 to 1 multiplexer will be created. 3 to 8 decoders will be created with 2 of 2 to 4 decoders as well as 8 to 1 multiplexer will be created with a 3 to 8 decoder and with some logic gates. Instead of defining separate variable for different inputs and outputs, here they will be named as busses. Finally, circuits should be simulated and should be checked for the functionality.</p>

<p>Decoders and multiplexers are major 2 components in the microprocessor. Decoder converts its ùëõ inputs to 2^ùëõ unique outputs. In this lab, 2 to 4 decoder converts it 2 inputs into 4 and 3 to 8 decoder does the same. Multiplexers have been used to select one data according to the arrangement of the inputs. Here 8 to 1 multiplexer chooses one value from 8 values according to its inputs.
Simulating designed decoders and multiplexers via Vivado before building them physically will save a lot of cost as well as time.</p>
