## Component Designing Projects with Verilog HDL.

#### In this lab series, various components of a computer are designed using Verilog HDL. The components are designed using the structural modeling approach and then tested using test benches.

#### The components designed are:

1. Lab 3 - Ripple Carry Adder
2. Lab 4 - Combinational Circuits
3. Lab 5 - Counter
4. Lab 6 - Arithmatic Unit
5. Lab 7 - 7 Segment Display

#### Ripple Carry Adder

##### Assigned Task:

<p>In the microprocessor, ALU does a significant job in arithmetic and logical processing. Adder/subtractor is the most important and basic element in this ALU. Here we are asked to design the logical circuit of Half Adder which is the basic component of Adder. Then using 2 Half adders, we are asked to build a Full Adder and then using 4 Full adders we should build a Ripple Carry Adder and simulate them in Vivado.</p>


*Xilinx Vivado 2018.2 is used for the design and testing of the components.*
