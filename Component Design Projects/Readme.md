## Component Designing Projects with Verilog HDL.

#### In this lab series, various components of a computer are designed using Verilog HDL. The components are designed using the structural modeling approach and then tested using test benches.

#### The components designed are:

- Lab 3 - Ripple Carry Adder
- Lab 4 - Combinational Circuits
- Lab 5 - Counter
- Lab 6 - Arithmatic Unit
- Lab 7 - 7 Segment Display

#####*Xilinx Vivado 2018.2 is used for the design and testing of the components.*#####
